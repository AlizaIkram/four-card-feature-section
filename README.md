## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned using Grid layout efficiently and by combining the Mobile-first approach it became very easy to design this particular layout.

### Continued development

I'll continue to gain proficiency in using Grids and Mobile-first approach.

### Useful resources

- [Resource](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Grids. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
